## Foundational Papers

| Title | Authors | Publication | Summary | Link |
|-------|---------|------------|---------|------|
| Hyperdimensional Computing: An Introduction to Computing in Distributed Representation with High-Dimensional Random Vectors | Pentti Kanerva | Cognitive Computation, 2009 | This paper introduces the concept of hyperdimensional computing, explaining how high-dimensional random vectors can be used for distributed representation and computation. | [Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-009-9009-8) |
| Fully Distributed Representation | Pentti Kanerva | Real World Computing Symposium, 1997 | This paper introduces Binary Spatter Codes (BSC), a model of HD/VSA that uses binary vectors and bitwise operations. | [Paper](http://www.cap-lore.com/RWC97-kanerva.pdf) |

Rachkovskij, Evgeny Osipov, Abbas Rahimi | ACM Computing Surveys, 2022 & 2023 | This 2-part survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of HD/VSA. | [Part I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06077), [Part II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15424) |

## HD Classifiers

| Title | Authors | Publication | Summary | Link |
|-------|---------|------------|---------|------|
| OnlineHD: Robust, Efficient, and Single-Pass Online Learning Using Hyperdimensional System | Alejandro Hern√°ndez-Cano, Namiko Matsumoto, Eric Ping, Mohsen Imani | DATE, 2021 | This paper presents OnlineHD, an adaptive learning algorithm for hyperdimensional computing that achieves higher classification accuracy than single-pass models. After a single-pass training, OnlineHD iteratively updates the model memory based on the similarity score. | [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474107) |
| LeHDC: Learning-Based Hyperdimensional Computing Classifier | Shijin Duan, Yejia Liu, Shaolei Ren, Xiaolin Xu | DAC, 2022 | This paper introduces LeHDC, which replaces the label prediction stage in the HD classification pipeline with a binary neural network and uses a neural network's training strategy to minimize loss. | [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3489517.3530593) |
| A Brain-Inspired Low-Dimensional Computing Classifier for Inference on Tiny Devices | Shijin Duan, Xiaolin Xu, Shaolei Ren | TinyML, 2022 | LDC uses low-dimensional vectors to achieve high accuracy by mapping its operations to an equivalent neural network and using a principled training approach. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04894) |
| HyperCam: Low-Power Onboard Computer Vision for IoT Cameras | Chae Young Lee, Pu (Luke) Yi, Maxwell Fite, Tejus Rao, Sara Achour, Zerina Kapetanovic | ArXiv, 2025 | This paper introduces HyperCam, an onboard HD classifier for low-power IoT cameras. For real-time inference, HyperCam uses novel encoding methods that aggressively reduce memory consumption and latency. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10547) |
